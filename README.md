# Block Hopper 

## Overview
**Block Hopper** is a simple 2D block-jumping game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
You control a green player block that must jump over red obstacles moving across the screen.  
Press the **Enter key** to jump — the goal is to survive as long as possible and earn points for every obstacle you pass!
